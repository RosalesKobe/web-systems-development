            <h2>WRIGHT PARK</h2>
            <p>Cool climate, wonderful scenery, and horseback riding adventure — these are just some of the reasons why Wright Park has become one of the most visited and well-loved parks in the Philippines’ summer capital, Baguio City.
              The park is named after Governor Luke E. Wright who ordered architect Daniel Burnham to develop the place for American soldiers and civilians alike to have an area for recreation and leisure.             
              The Wright Park Riding Circle holds the main activity that people go to the park for — horseback riding. In fact, Wright Park is often mistakenly called “Ride Park” especially by kids because of the riding activity done here. </p>
