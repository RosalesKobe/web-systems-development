            <p>
              Baguio City, located in the Philippines, was established as a hill
              station by the Americans in 1900 during their colonial rule. It
              served as a retreat from the tropical heat and later became a
              major city. Baguio played a role in World War II and was partially
              destroyed. It was rebuilt and has since thrived as a popular
              tourist destination, known for its cool climate and scenic beauty.
